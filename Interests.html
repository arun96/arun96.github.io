										<h2>Interests</h2>
									</header>
									<p> I'm interested in a number of things outside of my work. First and foremost, I am obsessed with football (soccer, not handegg). In particular, I am crazy about Liverpool FC and football analytics. I am fascinated in the intangibles in football - it is a game with a high number of degrees of freedom, and it is extremely difficult to quantify both on the pitch factors such as control, threat, and momentum, but also off the pitch factors such as the impact of a certain stadium, player fatigue, and the impact of injuries.</p>

									<p>I am very passionate about maintaining fan ownership in football clubs, and as such, have been a member of <a target="_blank"  href="https://thedonstrust.org/">the Dons Trust</a> for over a decade now. The Dons Trust is the fan ownership collective of AFC Wimbledon, a majority fan-owned team in the fourth division of the English football pyramid. Once Wimbledon FC, the team was stripped from fans in the early 2000s and shifted to the franchise that now plys its trade in Milton Keynes. AFC Wimbledon is the phoenix club that arose from that, and is one of the best stories you will find in professional sport.</p>

									<p>I am an avid home cook, which started out of necessity during the pandemic and has now blossomed into my most enjoyable hobby. I specialize in Indian cuisine (being from both the North and South, I am familiar with both), but I enjoy cooking a range of things.</p>

									<p>I am a huge fan of many series in pop culture, including Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Dune, and probably most time-consumingly, Pokemon. I am an avid Pokemon Go player, an active member of the Pokemon Go Baltimore community, and am currently working on completing a full living dex in Pokemon Home (you can track my progress in this endeavor <a target="_blank"  href="https://pokedextracker.com/u/wookiechew23/home-dex">here</a>).</p>

									<p>I am also an avid collector of many things. I used to collect coins, I have a modest collection of Liverpool FC kits, but I primarily collect Lego Star Wars sets and watches.</p>

												<h3>Pokemon Home Living Dex</h3>
											</header>
											<p>A goal of mine for many years has been to, as the series implies we must, collect 'em all. This quest begun in earnest in 2021, and has grown to include all the Pokemon included in Generation 9 and its DLCs. There are few stipulations, but these include that I must achieve this using only my phone and my Switch (no past games, no old events), and that as far as possible it must avoid in-person events (such as GameStop giveaways, which are truly stupid in a pandemic).</p>
											<p> As of May 2025, I am currently four Pokemon away (out of 1025) from completing this goal: Magearna, Volcanion, Iron Crown and Iron Boulder. I expect to reduce this to just one - Magearna - by the end of the summer, thanks to Pokemon Go Fest 2025 and the Pokemon Violet DLC.</p>
