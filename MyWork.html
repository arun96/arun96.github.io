									<p>As a computer scientist and computational biologist, my work is primarily focused on where these two disciplines intersect.</p>

									<p>In computer science, my primary areas of interest are algorithms, machine learning approaches for large datasets, sketching and approximation algorithms to speed up existing tasks, and cryptography and computer security (especially around genomic data).</p>

									<p>As a computational biologist, I am interested in identifying patterns of variation in certain populations, and understanding how these variants are represented in or absent from widely used genomic datasets. I am particularly interested in understanding the limitations of linear reference genomes, and in the variation - both globally common and individual- or population-specific - that is discarded in traditional approaches.</p>

									<p> In my work, I have used my computer science background to develop methods that accelerate existing tasks in genomics, lowering the computational barriers to genomic analysis. I have also developed approaches to analyze large datasets, and combine data from a number of sources to construct a better picture of variation present in large genomic data.</p>

									<p> I did my PhD in Computer Science with <a href="https://schatz-lab.org/" class="link">Dr. Michael Schatz</a> at Johns Hopkins University, focusing on a range of topics in computational genomics. These included Sapling, a learned index structure approach for speeding up suffix array queries, sketching and sampling approaches to speed up long read classification from metagenomic experiments, and approaches to utilize unmapped reads to better understand variation in South Asian individuals relative to widely used reference genomes. Full details of these projects, as well as others I have worked on, can be found below.</p>

										<h2>Assembling unmapped reads reveals missing variation in South Asian Genomes</h2>
									</header>
									<p> My latest work, and the major focus of my PhD dissertation, focuses on investigating and improving the representation of South Asian genomes in existing genomic datasets, as well as evaluating the improvements offered by new linear and pangenome references. This work has been presented at Biology of Genomes 2023, ASHG 2023, Biological Data Science 2024, and will be presented at Biology of Genomes 2025. As of May 2025, <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.05.14.653340v1" class="link">a pre-print is available on bioRxiv</a>. This work was done with Dr. Mike Schatz, <a href="https://mccoy-lab.org/" class="link">Dr. Rajiv McCoy</a>, and <a href="https://aabiddanda.github.io/" class="link">Dr. Arjun Biddanda</a>.</p>

										<h2>Beyond the Human Genome Project:<br />The Age of Complete Human Genome Sequences and Pangenome References</h2>

									<p> I was part of an effort to create a review summarizing the evolution of the human genome, from the earliest efforts in the late 90s and early 2000s, to the first complete human reference genome in T2T-CHM13, to the advent of human pangenomes.

									<p> Under the supervision of my undergraduate advisor <a target="_blank" href="http://www.brown.edu/Research/Istrail_Lab/sorin.php">Dr. Sorin Istrail</a> I completed a senior undergraduate honors thesis, titled "Approaches in Genomic Privacy". My thesis surveyed the current state of genomic privacy, reviewed potential solutions (both technical and non-technical), and included my projections for the future of the field.
