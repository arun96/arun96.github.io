									<p>As an aspiring computer scientist and computational biologist, my work is primarily focused on these two disciplines.</p>
									<p>In computer science, my primary areas of interest are algorithms, machine learning, sketching cryptography and computer security. In addition to my work in theoretical computer science, I have significant programming experience in Python, Java and R, and have worked with C, Go and Matlab before.</p>
									<p>As a computational biologist, I am interested in the intersections of biology and computer science. My areas of interest are in algorithms (especially those pertaining to the problems we encounter computational biology), computational genomics, genomic privacy, big data analysis, cryptography and computer security.</p>
									<p> I'm currently working with Dr. Mike Schatz at Johns Hopkins, as I pursue a PhD in Computer Science with a focus on Computational Genomics. My first project was "Sapling: Accelerating Suffix Array Queries with Learned Data Models", which focused on learned index structures/data models for genomics. It was published in Bioinformatics, and can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article-abstract/37/6/744/5941464">here</a>.</p>
									<p> My latest work is "Sketching and sampling approaches for fast and accurate long read classification", which focuses on sketching and sampling approaches to speed up read classification compared to existing high-overhead index and alignment based methods. This work has been published in BMC Bioinformatics, and can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-022-05014-0">here</a>.</p>
									<p> My current work focuses on investigating and improving the representation of South Asian genomes in existing genomic datasets, as well as evaluating the improvements offered by new linear and pangenome references. This work has been presented at Biology of Genomes 2023, and will be presented at ASHG 2023. Stay tuned for more exciting updates in the new future!</p>

											<p> During my time at Brown, I worked with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.brown.edu/Research/Istrail_Lab/sorin.php">Dr. Sorin Istrail</a>, as part of the Istrail Lab at Brown University. My senior thesis, supervised by Dr. Istrail, was on approaches in genomic privacy. The thesis can be found <a target="_blank"  href="https://ccmb.brown.edu/sites/g/files/dprerj841/files/ArunDasThesis%20(1).pdf">here</a>. I hope it serves as useful resource to anyone interested in the wonderful intersection of cryptography and genomics.</p>
											<p> While I was at Brown, I spent a considerable amount of time as a Teaching Assistant in the Computer Science department. Over the three years I served as TA, I helped teach over a thousand students - I held weekly TA hours, took part in development of teaching and testing materials, and spent hundreds of hours grading thousands of assignments.</p>

											<p>On the right, you can see an example of a heatmap generated by eye-tracking technology - considering the heatmaps of various versions of images allowed us to identify the effects of priming.</p>

											<p>Outside of the classroom, I was on the Brown Space Engineering team, which was working on Brown Universityâ€™s own nano-satellite (more on that <a target="_blank" href="http://arun96.github.io/BSE.html">here</a>!) and a teaching assistant in the Computer Science department for CS22 (Spring 2016, Spring 2017, Spring 2018) and CS1010 (Fall 2016 and Fall 2017).</p>
											<p>In the past I have also participated at Hackathons (including Yale Hacks and Hack@Brown), as well as the annual Google Games event in Cambridge, Massachusetts (both in 2016 and in 2017).</p>
