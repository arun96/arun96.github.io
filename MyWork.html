									<p>As an aspiring computer scientist and computational biologist, my work is primarily focused on these two disciplines.</p>
									<p>In computer science, my primary areas of interest are algorithms, data science, machine learning, cryptography and computer security. In addition to my work in theoretical computer science, I have significant programming experience in C, R, Python, Go, Matlab and Java, and have worked with Ruby, Swift and Interactive C before.</p>
									<p>As a computational biologist, I am interested in the intersections of biology and computer science. My areas of interest are in algorithms (especially those pertaining to computational biology), computational genomics, genomic privacy, big data analysis, cryptography and computer security.</p>
									<p> I'm currently working with Dr. Mike Schatz at Johns Hopkins, as I pursue a PhD in Computer Science. </p>

											<p> During my time at Brown, I worked with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.brown.edu/Research/Istrail_Lab/sorin.php">Dr. Sorin Istrail</a>, as part of the Istrail Lab at Brown University. My senior thesis, supervised by Dr. Istrail, was on approaches in genomic privacy. A copy is available on request.</p>

											<p>Outside of the classroom, I was on the Brown Space Engineering team, which was working on Brown Universityâ€™s own nano-satellite (more on that <a target="_blank" href="http://arun96.github.io/BSE.html">here</a>!) and a teaching assistant in the Computer Science department for CS22 (Spring 2016, Spring 2017, Spring 2018) and CS1010 (Fall 2016 and Fall 2017).</p>
											<p>In the past I have also participated at Hackathons (including Yale Hacks and Hack@Brown), as well as the annual Google Games event in Cambridge, Massachusetts (both in 2016 and in 2017).</p>
