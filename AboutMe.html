										<h2>A brief introduction</h2>
									</header>
									<p> Hello! My name is Arun Das (he/him). </p>
									<p>I'm a scientist with an interest in computer science and genomics. I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the <a href="https://www.igs.umaryland.edu/" class="link">Institute for Genome Sciences (IGS)</a>, inside the <a href="https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/" class="link">University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM)</a>. Previously, I was a PhD student at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, where I studied Computer Science and Genomics under the supervision of my advisor <a href="https://schatz-lab.org/" class="link">Dr. Michael Schatz</a>. I defended my PhD in May 2025.</p>

									<p>My research interests are algorithms for navigating and analyzing large genomic datasets, machine learning approaches to help handle large data, and cryptography and privacy. I am extremely passionate about education, accessibility and representation in genomics, and my work has been focused on understanding and bringing down the barriers to genomic analysis and research.</p>

									<p>Before starting my PhD at Johns Hopkins, I studied Computer Science and Computational Biology at Brown University. I graduated with a Bachelors of Science, with Honors, in 2018. My thesis was on approaches in genomic privacy, and was supervised by my advisor, Dr. Sorin Istrail.</p>

												<h3>More About Me</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Outside of my work, I am a life-long Liverpool FC fan (YNWA!). I have loved Liverpool for over twenty years now, and very few things have ever stopped me from watching us play (I've even watched us play on a tiny phone screen while hiking 17,000 feet above sea level in Himalayas). I'm a huge football fan in general, and have a great love of football analytics. I am fascinated with how data has been used to move the game forward, and am a big fan of the work done by so many in that space.</p>

											<p> I also love cricket (the Indian national side, and Kolkata Knight Riders) and its analytics side. I'm a huge Star Wars, Lord of the Rings and Dune aficionado, I love collecting Star Wars Lego, I'm an early-stage horophile, and a life-long gamer (especially Pokemon and FIFA). Most importantly, I'm a dad to my cat, Muffin.</p>

											<p>When I'm not working, I'm usually watching football, cooking something new at home, playing videogames, or out playing Pokemon Go with my friends (I am an active member of Pokemon Go Baltimore).</p>

											<p>I have been fortunate enough to have the opportunity to travel and live all around the world. I am fluent in English and Hindi, and familiar with Spanish, Malayalam and Bengali. I spent 10 years learning Mandarin when I was younger, and I'm also currently learning Russian.</p>

											<p>This website is a collection of all the things I find important: things I have done, problems I have solved, and topics I am interested in. I hope you find it useful and easy to navigate.</p>

											<p> The site itself done in HTML5 and CSS, and is hosted on Github pages. Feel free to check out the code <a href="https://github.com/arun96/arun96.github.io" class="link">here</a>.
